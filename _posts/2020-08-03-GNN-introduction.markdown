In this post, I want to share with you a notebook that I've prepared to play and understand `Graph Neural Networks`. It's an introductory material that shows you the internals of the most popular types of `Graph Neural Networks` and at the same time compares them to some basic and well known `Machine Learning` techniques.

You can find the notebook from my Google Drive [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/154W9FmB4D9WRPBnyPY_cuPZyIdmFcSIz?usp=sharing), where you can copy it to your Drive and open it in Colab as well. Goolge Colab allows you to easily start this journey without even having to use your CPU to train the models!.

I will update this notebook to follow a more incremental approach so it is nicer to follow along.
